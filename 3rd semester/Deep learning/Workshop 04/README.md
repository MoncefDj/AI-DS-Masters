# Deep learning

This workshop focuses on designing a sentence auto-complete system using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The tasks involved are:

1. Uploading a corpus of sentences (dataset) of your choice.
2. Performing data cleaning and tokenization (removing stop words, digits, etc.) on the dataset.
3. Performing word embedding using existing libraries like Word2Vec or 1-Hot.
4. Splitting the dataset into inputs and expected outputs.
5. Designing an LSTM architecture (considering input shape, padding/truncation, and model nature).
6. Showing the model summary.
7. Training the model.
8. Evaluating the model by feeding different sentences and assessing performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision.
