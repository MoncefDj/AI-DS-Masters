# Deep learning

This workshop focuses on developing different autoencoder architectures for various purposes:

1. Designing a simple convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to reconstruct an image.
2. Using the latent space of the CAE to classify the dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
3. Proposing a denoising autoencoder to denoise, deblur, or inpaint a particular image.
4. Developing a recommender system by training an autoencoder on an M x N matrix (where M represents recommended items and N represents users) to rectify excluded values.
5. Training a variational autoencoder (VAE) on the MNIST digits dataset and generating digits based on the trained VAE.
