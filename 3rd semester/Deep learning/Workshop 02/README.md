# Deep learning

This workshop focuses on designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for ear print classification that can outperform existing CNNs in terms of effectiveness (accuracy, specificity, sensitivity) and efficiency (number of parameters). The tasks involved are:

1. Using the AWE dataset, which has been extensively experimented with in the literature.
2. Exploring various improvements to CNNs, such as initialization, pre-processing, batch normalization, data augmentation, and L2 regularization.
3. Comparing the performance with a provided CNN architecture that achieved an accuracy of 64%.
