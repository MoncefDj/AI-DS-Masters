# Machine Learning Applications Workshop: Time Series Forecasting on ETTh1 Multivariate

This workshop focuses on time series forecasting using the ETTh1 multivariate dataset, which is a subset of the ETT-small dataset. The ETT-small dataset provides two years of data recorded at both minute-level and hourly-level frequencies from two regions in a Chinese province.

The task is to predict the "OT" (Oil Temperature) feature, which reflects the condition of electricity transformers and can help optimize their usage and prevent unnecessary waste.

The workshop involves working with the ETTh1 dataset, which is the hourly-level dataset for one of the regions. The dataset includes the following features:

- date: The timestamp of the observation.
- HUFL: High Useful Load.
- HULL: High Useless Load.
- MUFL: Middle Useful Load.
- MULL: Middle Useless Load.
- LUFL: Low Useful Load.
- LULL: Low Useless Load.
- OT: Oil Temperature (target variable for prediction).

The tasks involved in this workshop may include:

1. Exploring and understanding the dataset.
2. Preprocessing and feature engineering, if necessary.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Selecting and implementing appropriate time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet, etc.).
5. Training and evaluating the models using relevant metrics.
6. Comparing the performance of different models.

The goal is to develop accurate models for predicting the oil temperature of electricity transformers, which can help optimize their usage and prevent unnecessary waste.
