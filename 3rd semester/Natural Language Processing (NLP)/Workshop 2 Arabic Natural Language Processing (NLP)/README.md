# Arabic Fake News Detection: Machine Learning Models for Real-World Applications

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for detecting fake news in Arabic. The dataset includes a collection of Arabic news articles, labeled as credible or not credible, along with their titles, text, and publication dates.

The tasks involved in this project include:

1. **Exploring and Understanding the Dataset**:

   - Investigating the structure and distribution of the Arabic Fake News dataset.
   - Analyzing the features such as titles, text, and labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Combining titles and content for better context.
   - Cleaning the data, including tokenization and removing stopwords.
   - Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

3. **Data Splitting**:

   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. **Feature Extraction**:

   - Using vectorization to convert text into numerical features for machine learning.

5. **Model Selection and Implementation**:

   - Implementing various machine learning models, including:
     - Naive Bayes
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
     - XGBoost

6. **Model Training**:

   - Training the models on the training set.

7. **Model Evaluation**:

   - Evaluating the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Comparing model performance to identify the best-performing algorithms.

The goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable machine learning models for detecting fake news in Arabic. These models can be useful for media organizations, researchers, and policymakers to combat misinformation and promote credible journalism.
