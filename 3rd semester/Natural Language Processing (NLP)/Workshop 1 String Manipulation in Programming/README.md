# Workshop 1: String Manipulation in Programming

This workshop focuses on various string manipulation techniques essential for text processing in programming. Participants will learn how to perform operations on strings, which are crucial for data analysis and natural language processing.

The tasks involved in this workshop may include:

1. Counting the number of words in a sentence.
2. Searching for one string within another.
3. Counting the occurrences of a specific word in a text.
4. Analyzing the context in which a word appears.
5. Conducting exact searches for strings.
6. Performing pattern searches using regular expressions.
7. Reading text data from files.
8. Implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify named entities in text.
9. Manipulating a corpus by:
   - Creating a corpus.
   - Adding, deleting, and retrieving documents from the corpus.
   - Counting the number of documents and sentences, and performing various operations (1-8) on the corpus.

The goal is to equip participants with the skills needed for effective string manipulation and text processing, which can be applied in various programming and data analysis tasks.
