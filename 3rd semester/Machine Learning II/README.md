# Machine Learning 2 Workshop: Evaluating and Tunning Machine Learning Models for Real-World Applications

This workshop focuses on evaluating and tuning machine learning models for predicting car sales using the Car Sales dataset. The dataset includes various features related to different cars, such as price, size, and other relevant details.

The tasks involved in this workshop may include:

1. Exploring and understanding the Car Sales dataset.
2. Preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering, if necessary.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Selecting and implementing appropriate machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, etc.).
5. Training the models on the training set.
6. Evaluating the models' performance using cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to obtain more reliable performance estimates.
7. Analyzing the models' strengths and weaknesses, and identifying areas for improvement.
8. Tuning the hyperparameters of the models using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize their performance, potentially using cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
9. Comparing the performance of different models and their tuned versions.
10. Interpreting the results and providing insights into the factors that influence car sales.

The goal is to develop accurate and robust machine learning models for predicting car sales based on the given features. This can be useful for car manufacturers, dealers, or other stakeholders in the automotive industry to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies.
